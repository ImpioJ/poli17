    "what-poli-header": "WHAT IS POLIN APPRO?",
    "what-poli": "Polin Appro is a legendary pub crawl in the city centre of Helsinki, organized by the Hosts and Hostesses (IE) of the Aalto University Student Union. The pub crawl is located around Vanha Poli, the origins of engineering students, limiting the area from Punavuori to Kamppi. This year the pub crawl is organized for the fifth time. In all the previous years, the party has been incredible when a crowd of students and student-minded people regardless of their degree have taken over the streets of Helsinki. Unlike other pub crawls, Polin Appro changes every year. This year, you get to enjoy video games in the form of special checkpoints.",
    "what-appro-header": "WHAT IS AN APPRO?",
    "what-appro": "The idea of the appro is to visit the pubs marked in the appro ticket and collect drink stamps. You get an overall badge at the afterparty depending on the number of stamps that you have collected during the evening. In Polin Appro, you have four hours to collect stamps. After the pub crawl, you can head to Apollo Live Club to the official afterparty. Free admission with the appro ticket.",
    "what-ie-header": "WHAT IS IE?",
    "what-ie": "IE, meaning the Hosts and Hostesses (\"Isännistö and Emännistö\") is a committee operating under AYY's Teekkari Section, which organises events. IE has traditionally been a committee that includes persons in charge of events in engineering student associations. Along with AYY, we now also have a few business and arts students in IE. Polin Appro is the largest event organised by IE. The whole bunch of people are united by their enthusiasm and dedicated attitude in event organising, creating an opportunity for everyone to have fun.",
